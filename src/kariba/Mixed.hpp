//! Class for mixed particles, inherited from the generic Particles class in
//! Particles.hh the minimum momentum of the PL is always be assumed to be the
//! averge momentum of the thermal note: ndens is number density per unit
//! momentum
//!
//! The reasons the integrands are friends is kind of magic. Basically, we need
//! pointers to the private members Temp/thnorm/theta/whatever to set the
//! parameters of the integrand functions in the GSL libraries. In C++ this is
//! not possible for non-static private member functions (because otherwise we
//! could access private members from the outside by using a pointer). To quote
//! the compiler error, C++ forbids taking the address of an unqualified or
//! parenthesized non-static member function to form a pointer to member
//! function. And we need a pointer member function void *p to set up the
//! integrands for GSL libraries. By using a friend function we can instead set
//! up a set of parameters whose value is that of a pointer which points at the
//! values stored in the private members; by doing this, we can not change the
//! private members' values (correctly so) but we can still access their
//! numerical value and use it elsewhere.
